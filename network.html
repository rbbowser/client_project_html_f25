            <h2>Build Your Professional Network</h2>
            <p>
                Networking is one of the most powerful tools for career success, yet many students find it intimidating. 
                At UMSI, we believe networking is simply about building genuine professional relationships that benefit 
                both you and others in your field. Whether you're connecting with alumni, industry professionals, or 
                peers, these resources will help you approach networking with confidence and purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Strong professional networks open doors to opportunities that might never be posted publicly. They 
                provide insights into career paths, company cultures, and industry trends. Most importantly, they 
                connect you with people who can offer guidance, mentorship, and support throughout your career journey.

            <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>I'm introverted. How can I network effectively?</strong><br>
                    Focus on one-on-one conversations rather than large events. Online networking through LinkedIn can be less intimidating, and informational interviews allow for deeper connections.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What do I say when reaching out to someone I don't know?</strong><br>
                    Be honest about your connection (UMSI student, found them through LinkedIn, etc.), specific about your ask, and concise in your message. Check our email templates for examples.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How do I maintain professional relationships over time?</strong><br>
                    Send periodic updates about your progress, share relevant articles or opportunities, and offer help when you can. Quality matters more than frequency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>When should I start networking?</strong><br>
                    Now! Networking is most effective when you're not desperately job searching. Start building relationships early in your academic program.
