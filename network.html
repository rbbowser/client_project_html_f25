            <h2>Build Your Professional Network</h2>
            <p>
                Networking is one of the most powerful tools for career success, yet many students find it intimidating. 
                At UMSI, we believe networking is simply about building genuine professional relationships that benefit 
                both you and others in your field. Whether you're connecting with alumni, industry professionals, or 
                peers, these resources will help you approach networking with confidence and purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Strong professional networks open doors to opportunities that might never be posted publicly. They 
                provide insights into career paths, company cultures, and industry trends. Most importantly, they 
                connect you with people who can offer guidance, mentorship, and support throughout your career journey.
