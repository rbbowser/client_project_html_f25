            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>How long should my resume be?</strong><br>
                    For most UMSI students and new grads, one page is best. More experienced professionals may require two pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Do I need a different resume for each application?</strong><br>
                    It's wise to tailor your resume to the requirements and keywords of each opportunity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is it okay to include coursework or student projects?</strong><br>
                    Absolutely! UMSI coursework and projects are valued by employers, especially if they show relevant skills and impact.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How often should I update my resume?</strong><br>
                    Update your resume every semester, after major projects, or whenever you gain a new role or responsibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What file format should I use?</strong><br>
                    PDF is generally preferred to maintain formatting, but some employers may request Word documents. Always check the application instructions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Should I include a photo or personal information?</strong><br>
                    In the US, avoid including photos, age, marital status, or other personal information that isn't relevant to your qualifications.
